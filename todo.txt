jsyntaxpane.SyntaxView extends PlainView

replace PlainView by ScaledLabelView
- replaces
   int Utilities.drawTabbedText
   by
   float drawTabbedText

or
override methods in SyntaxView
by methods implemented in ScaledLabelView



1) CodeRunner
  - create from XML
  - serialize to XML
  - find installed languages
    => go for most recent installation <= time stamp of executable
    => enable/show menu items accordingly

2) Installer	


4) youtube tutorials / python course
   ( Trailblazer?, ITEE presentation, Enthought Distribution)
   
5) Infinity 2.0

	
- when loading and linked file is missing then print error but do not cancel loading

- Helperlines are lagging when scene graph is complex
    => replace by xor <= tricky with zooming/dragging => remove helperlines and redraw

    http://java.comsci.us/examples/awt/graphics/setXORMode.html


- selection of text section in ICode element does work only properly when text has just been edited
  for newly created code selection jumps to beginning
  => problem with focus?

- copy of IMenu(xml) doesn't work

- "layout manager" for IOutput
   => should follow bottom of code bounds
   => should always be below code if underneath
   => update position when code bounds changes

- depending on OS enable/disable certain functions
  - open links - only windows


- links
  - show icon/arrow?


- improve kinetic dragging, zooming, scrolling

- replace XML properties of an IObject by an abstract features concept (key:value:type) (or yaml)
  => create output and input formats from that
  => support inheritance
  => describe a presentation by IObjects with their features  => presentation data structure
  => implement UNDO by storing differentials of the presentation data structures

- implement scalable editor with syntax highlighting (not using swing)
  => http://java-sl.com/Scale_In_JEditorPane.html
  => http://www.duncanjauncey.com/btinternet/zoomdesk/download.html

- improve home button
  - set home position

- kinetic zooming with page up/down buttons

- slider/navigator

- focus/clipping selection rect
  => all objects within selection objects are zoomed to fit on screen,
  all other objects are hidden

- icons for file objects
  Icon ico = FileSystemView.getFileSystemView().getSystemIcon(file);
  Image image = ((ImageIcon) ico).getImage();

- spell checking:
  http://jortho.sourceforge.net/

- animation
  => translation, scaling to a node/node group <= parent nodes = container
  => definition of animation order

- save, load as zip-file

- UNDO
